                At CoLearn, our mission is to empower students to learn
                together, build projects, and foster collaboration. We believe
                that learning is more engaging and effective when done as a
                team. Our platform enables students to connect based on their
                skills and interests, and embark on personalized learning
                journeys guided by AI assistance.
